Seamless Agent enhances GitHub Copilot by providing interactive user confirmation tools. It allows AI agents to ask for user approval before executing actions, ensuring you stay in control.

## Features

### Ask User Tool (`#askUser`)

A Language Model tool that enables Copilot to interactively prompt you for confirmation or additional input during chat sessions.

- **User Confirmation** — Get explicit approval before Copilot executes critical actions
- **Interactive Input** — Provide additional context or instructions mid-conversation
- **Task Validation** — Confirm whether a task was fulfilled your specs
- **Seamless Integration** — Works naturally within the Copilot Chat workflow

## Usage

Once installed, the `ask_user` tool is automatically available to GitHub Copilot Chat.

### Automatic Usage

Copilot will automatically use this tool when it needs your confirmation. When triggered:

1. A notification appears in VS Code
2. Click "Open Console" to open the request panel
3. Type your response
4. Copilot continues based on your input

## Tips

### Recommended System Prompt

To ensure the AI always asks for your confirmation before completing tasks, add the a custom rule similar to the following:

```
# Ground rules NEVER BREAK IT, NO EXCEPTIONS
- When never you have a question, or a decision to make, always ask the user through the tool `mcp_ask_user `
- Never stop a task without permission from the tool `mcp_ask_user`
```

You can add this in Antigravity by opening the `Agent Option` the `Agent` panel and clicking in the option `Customizations`. Then you add a new `Rule` for general use or `Workflow` or specifics workflows.

Note that Antigravity workflow already creates `Walkthroughs` and `Planing` documents where you can refine the task. If you intent is to change this behavior you can try explicitly explain it to the agent.

## Requirements

- Antigravity 1.104.0 or higher
- **Node.js** (required for MCP server integration with Antigravity)

## Antigravity MCP Integration

Seamless Agent integrates with Antigravity IDE via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). When the extension starts, it:

1. Launches a local HTTP API service
2. Registers itself in `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` using a command-based configuration

### How It Works

![](./resources/flow.svg)

The MCP config uses the standard command format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seamless-agent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<extension-path>/bin/seamless-agent-mcp.js", "--port", "<port>"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Node.js not found**: Ensure Node.js is installed and available in your system PATH
- **Connection issues**: Use the "Restart API" button in the status bar to restart the service

## Extension Settings

This extension works out of the box with no configuration required. You only need to instruct your agent to use it.

## Known Issues

None at this time. Please report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/jraylan/seamless-agent/issues).
