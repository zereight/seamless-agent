Seamless Agent enhances GitHub Copilot by providing interactive user confirmation tools. It allows AI agents to ask for user approval before executing actions, ensuring you stay in control.

## Features

### Ask User Tool (`#askUser`)

A Language Model tool that enables Copilot to interactively prompt you for confirmation or additional input during chat sessions.

- **User Confirmation** — Get explicit approval before Copilot executes critical actions
- **Interactive Input** — Provide additional context or instructions mid-conversation

  - **Paste Images** — Paste images directly into the input area for context
  - **References & Attachments** — Reference files in your workspace using `#filename` and attach files to your response

- **Task Validation** — Confirm whether a task was fulfilled your specs

### Plan Review Tool (`#planReview`)

A Language Model tool that presents Markdown content in a dedicated review panel, so you can approve it or request changes with comments anchored to specific parts of the plan.

- **Plan Review Panel** — Review the plan in a focused editor-like view
- **Targeted Feedback** — Add comments tied to specific headings/paragraphs/list items
- **Structured Output** — Returns `{ status, requiredRevisions: [{ revisedPart, revisorInstructions }], reviewId }` to the agent
- **Safer Automation** — Prevents execution before you approve the approach

> Note: `#approvePlan` is supported for backwards compatibility, but `#planReview` is the recommended tool.

### Walkthrough Review Tool (`#walkthroughReview`)

A Language Model tool that presents Markdown content as a step-by-step walkthrough in a dedicated panel, so you can add comments and request revisions.

- **Walkthrough Panel** — Great for guided, sequential steps
- **Comment Support** — Add feedback anchored to specific parts of the walkthrough
- **Structured Output** — Returns `{ status, requiredRevisions: [{ revisedPart, revisorInstructions }], reviewId }`

### History (Requests, Plan Reviews)

The Seamless Agent panel includes a unified History timeline (newest first), with filters:

- **All**
- **Ask User**
- **Plan Review**

You can open ask_user details, open plan review panels from history, and delete individual items.

### Approve Plan Tool (`#approvePlan`) (Deprecated)

Backwards-compatible alias for plan review.

## Usage

Once installed, the tools are automatically available to GitHub Copilot Chat.

### Automatic Usage

Copilot will automatically use this tool when it needs your confirmation. When triggered:

1. A notification appears in VS Code
2. Click "Open Console" to open the request panel
3. Type your response
4. Copilot continues based on your input

### Reviewing a Plan with `#planReview` (tool: `plan_review`)

Copilot will use this tool when it wants your sign-off on a plan before proceeding. When triggered:

1. A “Review Plan” editor panel opens
2. Hover a heading/paragraph/list item and click the comment icon to add feedback
3. Click **Approve** to proceed, or **Request Changes** to send feedback back to the agent
4. Copilot continues based on `{ status, requiredRevisions, reviewId }`

> You can still explicitly ask for `#approvePlan`, but prefer `#planReview`.

### Reviewing a Walkthrough with `#walkthroughReview` (tool: `walkthrough_review`)

Use this when you want a step-by-step guide presented for review/feedback.

1. A walkthrough editor panel opens
2. Add comments where you want changes
3. Click **Approve** or **Request Changes**
4. Copilot continues based on `{ status, requiredRevisions, reviewId }`

## Tips

### Recommended System Prompt

To ensure the AI requests approval at the right times, add the following to your custom instructions or system prompt:

```
When the task requires multiple steps or non-trivial changes, present a detailed plan using #planReview and wait for approval before executing.
If the plan is rejected, incorporate the comments and submit an updated plan with #planReview.
When the user asks for a step-by-step guide or walkthrough, present it using #walkthroughReview.
Always use #askUser before completing any task to confirm the result matches what the user asked for.
```

You can add this into your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your project

### Quick tutorial: using `#planReview` (tool: `plan_review`)

If you want to explicitly trigger plan review from the start, ask Copilot something like:

```
Before you change anything, write a step-by-step plan and present it with #planReview.
Wait for my approval (or requested changes). Only then implement the plan.
```

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.104.1 or higher
- GitHub Copilot Chat extension

## Extension Settings

This extension works out of the box with no configuration required. You only need to instruct your agent to use it.

## MCP / Antigravity

If you're using Antigravity IDE via MCP, see [README.antigravity.md](README.antigravity.md) for integration details and troubleshooting.

## Releasing (maintainers)

This repository uses Release Please to generate changelogs and tags based on Conventional Commits.

If a single squash-merge contains multiple logical changes, you can include **multiple Conventional Commit headers** in the commit message (or PR description, depending on your repo squash settings). Release Please will parse them as separate changelog entries, e.g.:

```
fix: prevent horizontal line comment

feat: add folder attachments

refactor: reorganize webview providers
```

For squash merges, you can also override the merge commit parsing by adding this block to the PR body:

```
BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
fix: prevent horizontal line comment
feat: add folder attachments
refactor: reorganize webview providers
END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
```
